# Challenge-1

## Description

This project was undertaken as a challenge assement of knowledge from the first week of class. This "Challenge 1" was aimed at furthering my knowledge of basic HTML and HTML semantic elements, as well as basic CSS and how CSS feeds into HTML via styling elements and classes. This project helped me understand the the importance of semantic HTML elements and how the can make following code easier, as well as the importance of accessibility features, such as the "alt" attritube to provide means of understanding an images content via text. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This project uses a basic HTML page with CSS designs to give users a mockup website of a fictional marketing company, Horiseon. The HTML code has been edited and modified to contain semantic elements as a way of highlighting the importance of logical, meaningful structure in HTML coding. Additionally, the CSS style sheet has been modified to contain more specific classes to give user a better understanding of how each CSS class plays into the HTML file. Users should be able to follow the HTML code with a basic understanding of what the elements do and how they work with one another, as well as understand how they are styled via the corresponding CSS element/class styles.
